# Changelog

## 1.5.1 — 2026-10-23

- Fixed left and right going the wrong way after switching between the front and back of the camera (seen on Osmo Pocket 4): the direction is now learned separately for each side

## 1.5 — 2026-10-20

- Vertical video (9:16, Pro): switch with the buttons at the top or ⇧⌘V, or just turn the Pocket upright. True vertical with the Pocket upright, or a sharp 1080×1920 crop from 4K without turning the camera
- Wide-angle lens correction (Pro): the new Wide Angle button straightens the curved edges of the DJI wide-angle lens, with a strength slider, keeping people at the edges natural
- Return to last position (Pro): when the camera reconnects it turns and zooms back to where you left it; landscape and vertical keep their own positions and scenes
- Reset camera position from the title bar: centers the camera at 1× and forgets the last position
- Deleting a scene asks for confirmation right next to it (Delete ✓ ✕)
- The preview no longer freezes when OBS, Google Meet or Zoom opens the camera
- Auto framing in vertical frames a talking-head shot
- Remembers resolution, frame rate and codec
- ⌘S saves a scene (photo is now ⇧⌘S); the mouse wheel zooms over the zoom control and joystick
- Correct zoom limits for Osmo Pocket 4 and 4P
- Only the Osmo Pocket connects automatically, with a hint when it isn't found
- The preview shows the same colors as recordings
- New look: SF Symbols icons, redesigned Settings, smooth transitions between camera modes
- The window opens on the display where you left it
- A short guided tour shows how to aim by dragging the picture and zoom by scrolling (Pro)
- The resolution button shows the right icon for 4K, 2.7K, HD or vertical
- Build 19 (2026-10-21): a little confetti celebration when you activate Pro in the app
- Build 18 (2026-10-21): future-proof signing, so updates and your Pro license keep working when the signing certificate is renewed

## 1.1.5 — 2026-10-20

- Save a scene with the + button and give it a name
- New PRO badge

## 1.1.3 — 2026-10-20

## 1.1.2 — 2026-10-19

- The camera stream pauses while the window is minimized or hidden, so the camera stays cooler

## 1.1.1 — 2026-10-19

- A clear prompt when the camera's own ActiveTrack takes over the gimbal, with one-click resume
- Face tracking no longer switches itself off when you move from side to side

## 1.1 — 2026-10-19
